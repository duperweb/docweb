            <p>my name is <em>dieuseul duperoy</em>, that's my story with the web.
                everybody knows that I am a lazy esasy guy, but today I wonder if I am the same?
                to become an excelent web developer you need to be hard-worker. I always said I wanted to be web designer, even though I did not know nothing about that.
                to be honest I used to say like this, it was not something I was really interested in. 
                not only that, learning was not thing. after period of time. 
                I couldn't find something to catch my attention, but I wanted something that I would learn with passion and for my life
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    it seem there was somebody here observing me and my life, He knows that I am lazy, I wouldn't make an effort if was not html, there come the passion.
                    <a href="">bucky roberts </a> videos on html, this funny teacher make me fall in love with web designer, too cool, too simple. I see there was something misssing to the page because most web sites dodnt't seem so simple like that. the learning of css became a need. and I started to search more video on web design, I went to <a href="newboston.com">newboston</a> to see videos and more videos on youtube. from videos to mobile app like <a href="">sololearn</a>, prohub. and javascript came in play.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>the way that I fall in love for web develpment for me it is incredible,
                    this the reason when they say, "you never know", this is really true.
                    a lover of music, art, voice become a web developper!
                    thia is true I love music, this is one of most the beautiful thing jehovah God created.
